				Check out the <a href="https://www.mec.ca/en/explore/algonquin-park-canoe-trip-checklist">Mountain Equipment Co-op</a> list for a pretty comprehensive list of things to bring for a camping trip.

			Always double check that you have all of your gear!!

				Here's a few additional things that I usually bring that are not mentioned in the MEC list:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Telescope - the stars are incredible on a clear night, especially if you are deep in the interior!</li>
				<li>Boxed wine - cans and bottles are not allowed in provincial parks, but plastic bags full of wine are.</li>
				<li>Packable pillow - this is listed as optional on the MEC site, but I would definitely recommend bringing one. Your neck will thank you in the morning.</li>
			</ul>
